                        notifications via text to tell them when a planet star, or other celestial event is about to
                        happen. Tech used was Django, Celery (For automating texts and rise and set times), Skyfield
                        API (For calculating rise and set times) and React for the UI. This was my final project at Carolina Code School.'/>

                            users, and filtering by some sort of status. There was no external technology used, but the
                            challenge of filtering by different things and the user accounts made this memorable. It was
                            also my first experience with React Router.'/>

                            may not be exactly pixel perfect, I think it looks good enough for using little more
                            than HTML and CSS. Every bit of this was copied as nearly as exactly as I could get the text.'/>
