            My name is Patrick, I am a recent graduate of Carolina Code School.
            Before now I worked for the City of Greenville. As far back as I can
            remember I have been interested in programming because I enjoy the
            challenges that it can throw at you. For years programming was a
            hobby, but a software engineer friend convinced me that I could do
            this as a career. I started teaching myself the basics of
            programming. When I wanted to expand my programming beyond what I
            could teach myself, I enrolled in Carolina Code School. I can
            already see the difference between how I coded before and after the
            class.
