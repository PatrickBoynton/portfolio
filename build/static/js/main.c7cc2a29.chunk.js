Before now I worked for the City of Greenville Parking Services for many years. It was a good job, but eventually I felt I could do more, and wanted more than a part time job that didn't seem that fulfilling.I have as far back as I can remember I have been interested in technology, specifically programming, because I enjoy the challenges that it can throw at you. In the past I have always considered it a hobby and not something that I could do as a career, but not all that long ago a friend of mine who was then currently working as a software engineer said that a lot of companies were dropping the requirement of a CS Degree and that got me thinking that maybe I could finally do this as a career. I started teaching myself the basics of programming that I felt I should know to become a programmer. The path was difficult, and at the time there weren't as many resources as there are now, and eventually I got to the point where I felt I needed help getting the extra training I didn't know how to find. My brother originally went to the Iron Yard and got a job through that, and that's what led me to sign up for the course at Carolina Code School.
